Multidimensional Arrays in C++ 

1. Definition

A multidimensional array is an array of arrays.

It extends the concept of a 1D array to 2D, 3D, or higher dimensions.

Example:

        2D Array (Matrix): int matrix[3][3]; (rows √ó columns)
        
        3D Array: int cube[2][3][4]; (layers √ó rows √ó columns)

2. Memory Representation

Stored in row-major order (contiguous memory blocks).

Example:

        int arr[2][3] = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}} is stored as 1,2,3,4,5,6 in memory.

3. Initialization

Static Initialization:

cpp

        int matrix[2][3] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };

Dynamic Initialization (using loops):

cpp

        for(int i=0; i<2; i++) {
            for(int j=0; j<3; j++) {
                cin >> matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        
4. Uses & Applications

‚úÖ Matrices in Mathematics & Physics (linear algebra, transformations)

‚úÖ Game Development (2D/3D grids, maps, pixel data)

‚úÖ Image Processing (storing RGB pixel values in a 2D/3D array)

‚úÖ Scientific Computing (storing multi-dimensional datasets)

‚úÖ Database Tables (representing rows and columns)

‚úÖ Graph Algorithms (adjacency matrix for graphs)

5. Advantages

‚úî Easy to Understand (logical structure for grids/tables)

‚úî Fast Access (O(1) time for direct indexing)

‚úî Efficient Memory Usage (contiguous allocation)

6. Limitations

‚ùå Fixed Size (static arrays require predefined dimensions)

‚ùå Memory Wastage (if not fully utilized)

‚ùå No Built-in Bounds Checking (can lead to buffer overflows)

7. Alternatives in Modern C++

a.Vectors of Vectors (vector<vector<int>>) for dynamic resizing.

b.Dynamic Arrays (new and delete for heap allocation).

c.Libraries (Eigen, Armadillo) for advanced matrix operations.

Proof (via Algorithm): Given:

Two matrices arr1 and arr2 of size row √ó column

A third matrix arr3 to store the sum

The program:

Accepts user input for dimensions row and column.

Reads elements of arr1 and arr2.

Computes arr3[i][j] = arr1[i][j] + arr2[i][j] for each valid index.

Displays all three matrices.

Conclusion: The program demonstrates the element-wise addition of two matrices. The resulting matrix arr3 contains the sum of corresponding elements from arr1 and arr2, satisfying the theorem.
