Multidimensional Arrays in C++ (Theory, Uses, and Purpose)
1. Definition
A multidimensional array is an array of arrays.

It extends the concept of a 1D array to 2D, 3D, or higher dimensions.

Example:

2D Array (Matrix): int matrix[3][3]; (rows × columns)

3D Array: int cube[2][3][4]; (layers × rows × columns)

2. Memory Representation
Stored in row-major order (contiguous memory blocks).

Example:

int arr[2][3] = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}} is stored as 1,2,3,4,5,6 in memory.

3. Initialization
Static Initialization:

cpp
int matrix[2][3] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };
Dynamic Initialization (using loops):

cpp
for(int i=0; i<2; i++) {
    for(int j=0; j<3; j++) {
        cin >> matrix[i][j];
    }
}
4. Uses & Applications
✅ Matrices in Mathematics & Physics (linear algebra, transformations)
✅ Game Development (2D/3D grids, maps, pixel data)
✅ Image Processing (storing RGB pixel values in a 2D/3D array)
✅ Scientific Computing (storing multi-dimensional datasets)
✅ Database Tables (representing rows and columns)
✅ Graph Algorithms (adjacency matrix for graphs)

5. Advantages
✔ Easy to Understand (logical structure for grids/tables)
✔ Fast Access (O(1) time for direct indexing)
✔ Efficient Memory Usage (contiguous allocation)

6. Limitations
❌ Fixed Size (static arrays require predefined dimensions)
❌ Memory Wastage (if not fully utilized)
❌ No Built-in Bounds Checking (can lead to buffer overflows)

7. Alternatives in Modern C++
Vectors of Vectors (vector<vector<int>>) for dynamic resizing.

Dynamic Arrays (new and delete for heap allocation).

Libraries (Eigen, Armadillo) for advanced matrix operations.

Conclusion
Multidimensional arrays are essential for structured data storage in C++, widely used in mathematics, gaming, and scientific computing. While they have limitations in flexibility, they remain efficient for fixed-size data handling.
